# Passport-Photo-Maker-With-Flask
Passport Photo Maker is a web-based application that allows users to easily upload an image, select a passport photo size, and customize the background color. The app processes the image by removing the background and resizing it to the chosen dimensions. Users can preview the processed image and download the final passport photo in one click.
